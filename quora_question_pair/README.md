This is my solution to the kaggle quora question pair challange!

File descriptions:

The submission consists of several scripts that generate features from the quora data set. Each FeaturesX.py file will load the input data, and previously generated files, and then subsequently at a new set of engineerd features.

The generated features are then saved in .pickle files. If I where to do this again, I would would use a different format for saving files to disk. Although pickling is convenient, saving larger datasets chews up memory.

I reccomend 32GB of system memory when if running these scripts.
